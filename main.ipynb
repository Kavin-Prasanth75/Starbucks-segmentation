    "Starbucks Corporation is an American coffee company. Today, it operates more than 30,000 retail stores in 80 markets around the world.[[1]](https://www.starbucks.com/about-us/company-information/starbucks-company-profile) The company hence is a big player in a vigorously competitive industry. One approach to retain customers is its [Starbucks Reward Program](https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/). Members of the program receive promotional offers. The company then hopes to use the data collected on its customer behavior to create business value and make data-driven decisions on how it engages with its customers base."

    "### 1.1. Project Overview\n",
    "The motivation behind this project is to propose a solution that helps the company in forming a better understanding of its customers base. In this project, an unsupervised learning technique will be used to segment customers and measure how each segment behave during different periods of the test. In particular, [K-Means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) clustering will be used. The provided dataset of courses will go through different phases at first before being ready for modeling. Starting with cleaning and ending with the final dataset grouped by customer profiles with their data aggreated. \n",

    "\n",
    "The company currently promotes products to customers with no prior knowledge of their segments. It is possible hence to analyse the data to find patterns in customer behaviors. This helps the company in aiming and tailoring its marketing efforts and resources to consumers who exhibit similar characteristics and are considered most likely to opt in for business's offerings. This form of target marketing is important because it helps the company by maximizing revenue while maintaining promotional campaigns cost smartly low. To do this, an unsupervised learning technique will be used to cluster customers into groups that can be be investigated separately to better understand their qualities and engage them accordingly."

    "### 1.3. Measurement Criterias\n",
    "\n",
    "When speaking about measurement criterias, two categories come to mind; _business metrics_ which assist in making decisions from a business point of view, and _technical metrics_ which assist in making assessment of the implementation of the algorithm used to cluster data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1. Business Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "All features will be investigated as much as possible, but there are two main themes used drive decisions made in this regard:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1` Distinguish the difference between how customers behave during non-promotional periods and how they behave when they are prompted to do so during promotionals periods. To measure this, [**R**ecency-**F**requency-**M**onetary Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFM_(market_research)) for examining customer value is used. In this model, recency, frequency and monetary values are assigned a score from one to five based on quantiles partition dividing range of values into equal-sized intervals. The RFM score is then obtained by taking the average of all three scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{RFM}_{score}={\\textrm{recency}_{score}+\\textrm{frequency}_{score}+\\textrm{monetary}_{score}\\over3}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "`2` Identify which customers react preferably to which types of offers. To measure this, offer view and completion rates will be used where the cardinalities of corresponding sets are divided by cardinalities of relevant sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{view rate}={n(\\textrm{offer viewed})\\over{n(\\textrm{offer received})}}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\textrm{completion rate}={n(\\textrm{offer completed})\\over{n(\\textrm{offer viewed})}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1. Technical Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For the algorithm chosen in this problem, K-Means, two appropriate methods will be used find the optimal number of clusters $k$ and to assess the model implementations; silhouette coefficient (SC) analysis and within-cluster Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "`1` Silhouette Coefficient (SC) analysis is a way to measure how close each point in a cluster is to the points in its neighboring clusters. Its a neat way to find out the optimum value for k during k-means clustering. Silhouette values lies in the range of [-1, 1]. A value of +1 indicates that the sample is far away from its neighboring cluster and very close to the cluster its assigned. Similarly, value of -1 indicates that the point is close to its neighboring cluster than to the cluster its assigned. And, a value of 0 means at the boundary of the distance between the two cluster. Value of +1 is ideal and -1 is least preferred. Hence, higher the value better is the cluster configuration. [[2]](https://kapilddatascience.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/using-silhouette-analysis-for-selecting-the-number-of-cluster-for-k-means-clustering/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, for one data point $i$ where $a(i)$ represents the calculated mean distance of point $i$ with regard to to all other points in the cluster it was assigned and $b(i)$ represents the calculated mean distance of point $i$ with regard to to all points in its closest neighboring cluster, silhouette is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s(i)={b(i)-a(i)\\over\\textrm{max}\\{b(i),a(i))\\}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is clear from the above equation that $$-1\\leq{s(i)}\\leq1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for one value representing the silhouette score that used for assessment of clustering outcomes, where $\\bar{s}(k)$ represents the mean $s(i)$ over all data of the entire dataset for a specific number of clusters $k$, silhouette coefficient is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SC=\\textrm{max}_k\\{\\bar{s}(k)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "`2` Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) analysis is a way to measure variability (dispersion) within a cluster by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and its cluster's mean, and therefore defined where $x_i$ is the $i$th data point and $n$ is the total number of data points: [[3]](https://hlab.stanford.edu/brian/error_sum_of_squares.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SSE=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-{1\\over{n}}\\Bigg(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2\\Bigg)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "SSE tends to decrease toward 0 as $k$-value increase because then each data point is its own cluster and there is no error between it and the mean of its cluster. The elbow method is then applied by plotting SSE for a range of $k$-values where where one should choose a $k$-value after which variability starts to have diminishing returns.

The nature of each record is described using `event`. The `value` column holds a value based on the `event` column. For offer received, viewed, and completed, the offer id is recorded. For transaction, the amount is recorded. Although this dataset is somehow abstract, 306534 rows and 4 columns, most of the cleaning process will be performed on this dataset."
